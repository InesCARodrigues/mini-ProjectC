# mini-ProjectC

<h2>Hello fellow programmer!</h2>

This is a mini-project I made back in 2012 in my freshman year at the <b>Department of Informatics Engineering</b>
(DEI) of the University of Coimbra (Portugal).

It was for my course of Introduction to Procedimental Programming in C.

You'll find some commands and comments in Portuguese. I'll switch it for english and clean up the code a bit as soon as I have some free time :)
